# personify-scim-server

Lean, mean and high performant open source Spring Boot Java SCIM server implementation with pluggable persistence layer.

Usefull for exposing a company's identities using the SCIM protocol and target point for your provisioning engine.

You can reuse the integrated storage layer or write a custom java implementation and wire it via configuration.


## intro

basic server implementation.

**currently implemented :**

- create, get, put, delete, search, patch ( with attributes and excludedAttributes )
- bulk with circular reference processing, maxOperations and maxPayloadSize 
- paging
- filtering (all operators,and,sort)
- discovery
- schema validation
- uniqueness constraint validation
- authentication : basic and OAUTH bearer token ( with roles )
- bearer token endpoint created and verified with forgerock IDM connector



**on the list :**

- filtering : complete specification
- /Me endpoint



##  

## usage

You can either choose to **download the binaries** or **clone the project** or **use the docker image**.

##  

For spinning up a scim server from the [downloaded binary](https://bitbucket.org/wouter29/personify-scim-server/downloads/) : 

> java -jar -Dserver.port=8080 personify-scim-server-1.1.2.RELEASE.jar

When port 8080 is already taken or other problems occur, adapt the server.port via the commandline.

SSL can also be configured this way ( see spring-boot documentation and sample in application.properties for this ).

##    

When you **clone** the project, you can build the binary from source.

Requirements to build are installation of a Java JDK 1.8+ and Maven.

For running the maven project :

> mvn spring-boot:run

##  

Use the integrated [postman collection](https://bitbucket.org/wouter29/personify-scim-server/src/master/scim.postman_collection.json) to test.

##  

A **load test** is also runnable, below the response of a single instance :

##  

```
>mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=be.personify.iam.scim.util.LoadTest -Dexec.args="http://localhost:8080/scim/v2 scim-user changeit 4 5000"

The current benchmark can give you already an idea about the throughput.

Executed on a single AMDÂ® Ryzen 3 2200g with the application consuming approximately 250MB for 4 threads and 5000 requests per thread.

| request | MEMORY     | MONGO      |
|---------|------------|------------|
| create  | 882  req/s | 225  req/s |
| get     | 1609 req/s | 1997 req/s | 
| search  | 159  req/s | 1446 req/s |
| delete  | 993  req/s | 2015 req/s |


##   

If you **really** do not want to build anything : spin up the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/personify/personify-scim-server)
> docker run -p 8080:8080 personify/personify-scim-server:1.1.2.RELEASE

Different environment variables can be used to choose the storage implementation, configure the connections and tune the behaviour.

 
##   

If you **really really** do not want to build or run it yourself : point the [postman collection ](https://bitbucket.org/wouter29/personify-scim-server/src/master/scim.postman_collection.json)
towards https://www.personify.be/scim/v2/Users ( 401 means unauthorized, so use correct basic auth credentials : scim-user/changeit )
create a environment in postman containing host and protocol.

##  

## configuration

Pimp the application.properties file included.


Two storage implementations are developed but if needed, you can implemented and wire your own implementation.

* memory storage implementation : basic fast access with flushing to a file, choose this for development or show case, demo testing, trial.
* mongo storage implementation : should be fine and scalable for development and production.

For using a OAUTH bearer token on forgerock openidm and other products, just point the endpoint to http://localhost:{8090}/scim/v2/token and use the credentials from the application.properties.

Custom schemas can also be configured simply by defining it in a file. Not tested yet, but give it a whirl and throw some feedback!

it will be looked at.

## thanks

feel free to contribute, we can all make life more easy for each other and SCIM on!
